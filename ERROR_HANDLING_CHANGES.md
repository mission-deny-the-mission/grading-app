# Error Handling System Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to replace the mock result system with a comprehensive error handling system in the grading application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mock Result System
- **File**: `tasks.py`
- **Lines**: 227-250 (approximately)
- **Change**: Removed the mock grading result that was returned when API keys were not configured
- **Previous Behavior**: When no API keys were configured, the system would return a fake grading result with "MOCK GRADING RESULT" text
- **New Behavior**: The system now returns proper error messages when API keys are not configured

### 2. Enhanced API Key Validation
- **File**: `tasks.py` - `process_submission` function
- **Change**: Added explicit checks for API key configuration before attempting to use any provider
- **New Validation Logic**:
  - OpenRouter: Checks if `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set and not equal to placeholder value
  - Claude: Checks if `CLAUDE_API_KEY` is set, not equal to placeholder value, and client is initialized
  - LM Studio: No API key required, but connection is validated

### 3. Improved Error Messages
- **File**: `tasks.py` - All grading functions
- **Changes**:
  - **OpenRouter**: Added specific error handling for authentication, rate limiting, and API errors
  - **Claude**: Added specific error handling for authentication, rate limiting, timeout, and general API errors
  - **LM Studio**: Added specific error handling for connection errors, timeouts, and HTTP status codes

### 4. Enhanced File Upload Error Handling
- **File**: `app.py` - `upload_file` function
- **Changes**:
  - Added proper API key validation before attempting grading
  - Improved error messages for unsupported providers
  - Added graceful file cleanup error handling
  - Added success/failure result validation

### 5. Improved Text Extraction Error Handling
- **File**: `tasks.py` - Text extraction functions
- **Changes**:
  - Added validation for empty documents
  - Added validation for corrupted PDF files
  - Improved error messages for file reading issues

## Error Message Examples

### API Key Not Configured
```
"OpenRouter API key not configured. Please configure your API key in the settings."
"Claude API key not configured. Please configure your API key in the settings."
```

### Authentication Errors
```
"OpenRouter API authentication failed. Please check your API key."
"Claude API authentication failed. Please check your API key."
```

### Connection Errors
```
"Could not connect to LM Studio at http://localhost:1234/v1. Please check if LM Studio is running."
```

### Rate Limiting
```
"OpenRouter API rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
"Claude API rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
```

### Unsupported Providers
```
"Unsupported provider: invalid_provider. Supported providers are: openrouter, claude, lm_studio"
```

## Testing

### Test Files Created
1. `test_error_handling.py` - Comprehensive test suite
2. `test_error_handling_simple.py` - Simplified test focusing on core functionality

### Test Coverage
- API key validation
- Provider configuration validation
- Error message accuracy
- Grading function error handling
- Connection error handling

## Benefits

1. **Clear Error Messages**: Users now receive specific, actionable error messages instead of fake results
2. **Better Debugging**: Developers can easily identify configuration issues
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users know exactly what needs to be configured
4. **Production Ready**: No more mock results in production environment
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles various error scenarios gracefully

## Migration Notes

- Existing jobs with mock results will continue to show those results
- New submissions will use the error handling system
- Users need to configure API keys to use the grading functionality
- The system gracefully handles missing or invalid API keys

## Configuration Requirements

To use the grading system, users must configure at least one of the following:

1. **OpenRouter**: Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **Claude**: Set `CLAUDE_API_KEY` environment variable  
3. **LM Studio**: Ensure LM Studio is running at the configured URL (default: `http://localhost:1234/v1`)

## Future Enhancements

- Add retry logic for transient errors
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
- Add support for additional AI providers
- Create a configuration validation endpoint
- Add user-friendly error pages in the web interface
